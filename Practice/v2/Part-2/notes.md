## To type
* If we want type inside in a container, we can add property to it that is *contenteditable = "true"*
* And later we can apply padding or get content by using *innerHTML* or *innerText*
* On hover, we can background effect also and border effect also.


## When we want to add more content but the size is less 
* We can use css  property that *outcome:auto;*

## Javascript 
* .innerHTML -> it will give the HTML inside of that element in a string
    * *update* -> div.innerHTML = "<p>Helo</p>" (it will override the whole HTML inside that element)
    * *access* -> div.innerHTML.querySelector("")
